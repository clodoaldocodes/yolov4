Installation
Before we can use the Python code for object detection, we need to install some dependencies:

Install Python on your system if it's not already installed. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official website.

Install OpenCV and NumPy using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Clone the Darknet repository and compile it:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.git
cd darknet
make
```

Download the YOLOv4 pre-trained weights and configuration files:

```
wget https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/data/coco.names
```
Alternatively, you can download the files manually from the Darknet website.

Usage
After installing the dependencies and downloading the necessary files, we can use the Python code to perform object detection on an image. Here's how:

Clone this repository or download the yolo-object-detection.py file.

Place the image you want to detect objects in the same directory as the yolo-object-detection.py file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the yolo-object-detection.py file and the image are located.

Run the following command to perform object detection on the image:

```
python yoloMainV4.py --image image.jpg
```
Replace image.jpg with the name of your image file.

The output will be a list of detected objects printed to the console.

And that's it! You should now be able to use the Python code for object detection using the YOLO model. If you encounter any issues, make sure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies and downloaded the YOLOv4 pre-trained weights and configuration files.
